# 🔐 zkp-prover

> WebAssembly Zero-Knowledge Proof module for **Kai-Turah Harmonic Identity**  
> 🧬 Powered by `Groth16` · 🧠 Optimized with `Poseidon Hash` · 🔮 Delivered via WASM

---

## ✨ What is this?

`zkp-prover` is a secure, deterministic WebAssembly module that performs fast **zero-knowledge proof generation and verification** using the Groth16 proving system with Poseidon hash. It is engineered for harmonic biometric identity — enabling sovereign authentication in decentralized, soul-bound systems like [Phi Network](https://phinetwork.org).

It works entirely in the browser or Node.js environment using a high-performance WASM backend compiled from Rust + Arkworks.

## 📦 Install

```bash
npm install zkp-prover
🧠 Usage
1. Import and initialize
ts
Copy
Edit
import init, { generate_proof, verify_proof } from "zkp-prover";

await init(); // Load the WASM module
2. Generate a Proof
ts
Copy
Edit
const proof = await generate_proof({
  voiceHash: "123...",
  retinaHash: "456...",
  kaiSignature: "789...",
});
3. Verify a Proof
ts
Copy
Edit
const isValid = await verify_proof(proof, {
  publicInputs: ["123...", "456..."],
});
